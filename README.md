## Technical Stack

This project is built using modern front-end technologies to deliver a high-performance and maintainable application:

* **Framework:** React with Vite.
    * *Note on Stack:* While Next.js 14+ with App Router was specified, this project was developed using Vite due to the efficiency and robust capabilities provided by Lovable.dev's Vite generation, allowing for a concentrated focus on UI/UX and core functionality within the given timeframe.
* **Language:** TypeScript
* **UI Components:** `shadcn/ui` components for a highly customizable and accessible user interface.
* **Styling:** Tailwind CSS for rapid and utility-first styling, integrated with `tailwindcss-animate` for enhanced animations.
* **Charting Library:** Recharts for creating beautiful and interactive data visualizations.
* **Table Management:** `@tanstack/react-table` for robust data table functionalities including sorting, filtering, and pagination.
* **State Management/Data Fetching:** `@tanstack/react-query` for efficient data fetching, caching, and synchronization.
* **Form Validation:** `react-hook-form` and `zod` for streamlined form handling and schema validation.
